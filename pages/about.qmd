I am currently a Ph.D. students in the [Department of Statistics](https://stat.wisc.edu/){target="_blank"} at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. 

## Previously

Before that I was a M.S. student and taught in the [Department of Statistics](https://stats.wfu.edu/){target="_blank"} at Wake Forest University. There I worked with [Dr. Sarah Lotspeich](https://www.sarahlotspeich.com/){target="_blank"} on correcting for missing data for surrogate validation in a clinical setting. I was a baby mathematician (undergraduate student) at [Smith College](https://www.smith.edu/){target="_blank"}  with a minor in Statistics and Data Science. 

## Fun thing

I have been playing in a [Gamelan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamelan){target="_blank"} ensemble for almost 10 years. Here's a recent piece we played!
